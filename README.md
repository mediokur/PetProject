# PetProject
##Java Learning Project
This project is to become more familiar with the JAVA language for some coursework and it may be expanded or it might be replaced in the future by something else. 
##Basics
There is no CRUD it simply simulates it through the use of putting and outputting information from hashtables keeping track of what pets are getting checked in. 
I haven't added a removal process yet and to make this a crud like app I would spend sooo much time with all the selection branches that if this was going to 
expand in any form it would do so with integration of a MySql or Postgress database being connected to the application and I would likely make it a gui app as well
since CRUD through tui is possible, but SQL has shown us that it isn't user friendly and thus not worth the effort currently.
